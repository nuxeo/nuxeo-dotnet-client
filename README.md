# About Nuxeo .NET Client #

[![Build Status](https://qa.nuxeo.org/jenkins/buildStatus/icon?job=master/nuxeo-dotnet-client-master-windows)](https://qa.nuxeo.org/jenkins/job/master/job/nuxeo-dotnet-client-master-windows/)

The Nuxeo .NET Client is a cross-platform client library developed in C# for the Nuxeo Automation and REST API.

Nuxeo .NET Client targets two platforms: `net45` and `dotnetcoreapp1.0`. This allows it to be used to develop apps for not only Windows but also Linux and Mac OS.

# Building #

If you are developing for `net45`, build the NuxeoClient_net45 solution on Visual Studio 2015 (or above).

If you are developing for `dotnetcoreapp1.0`, run:

```
cd src/NuxeoClient
dotnet restore
dotnet build
```

## Requirements ##

In order to build Nuxeo .NET Client, you must have installed the latest LTS of .NET Core 1.0.1 SDK (version 1.0.0-preview2-003133), or .NET 4.5 on a Windows setup.

### Developing for net45 ###

* Download and install [.NET Framework 4.5](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653)

* Visual Studio 2015 (or above) required.

### Developing for netcore1.0 ###

1. Install .NET Core:

    * [Linux instructions](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#linuxredhat)

    * [Mac OS instructions](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#macos)

    * [Windows instructions](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windowscmd)
   
Note: [Archived builds for .NET Core 1.0.1 SDK Preview 2 build 3131 and 3133](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/download-archives/1.0.1-preview2-download.md).

2. Add the following feeds to NuGet config file:

    * https://www.myget.org/F/aspnetvnext/

    * https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/

    If you do not yet have a config file, create it on:

    * For Mac OS & Linux: *~/.config/NuGet/NuGet.config*

    * For Windows: *%AppData%/NuGet/NuGet.Config*

    And paste the following contents:

```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <add key="AspNetVNext" value="https://www.myget.org/F/aspnetvnext/" />
    <add key="NuGet" value="https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
```

#### On Visual Studio 2015 ####

If you are using Visual Studio 2015 on Windows, you will need to install Visual Studio Update 3 and .NET Core 1.0.1 tools for Visual Studio Preview 2. [Instructions here](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windowsvs2015).

## Running the TCK ##

This project includes a Test Compatibility Kit (TCK) covering several tests on the client. In order for the tests to run, there must be an instance of the Nuxeo Server running, with [*nuxeo-automation-test*](https://packages.nuxeo.com/#browse/search=keyword%3Dnuxeo-automation-test) and [*nuxeo-jsf-ui*](https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace/package/nuxeo-jsf-ui) installed.

Before building and running the tests, the server's IP address should be updated in the *test/TCK/Config.cs* file.

### On Windows ###

1. Build the version of the TCK you want to test, by either running `tools\BuildNetCore.ps1` or  `tools\BuildNet45.ps1`.

2. Run the TCK with `tools\TestNetCore.ps1` or `tools\TestNet45.ps1`.

Note: If NuGet fails to install the dependencies when building the tests ("The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a send"), [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/53677845) provides a fix for it.

### On Mac OS or Linux ###

On the solution folder, run:

1. `dotnet restore` to download all dependencies

2. `cd test/TCK` to move to the TCK folder

3. `dotnet test` to run all tests

## QA

[![Build Status](https://qa.nuxeo.org/jenkins/buildStatus/icon?job=master/nuxeo-dotnet-client-master-windows)](https://qa.nuxeo.org/jenkins/job/master/job/nuxeo-dotnet-client-master-windows/)

# Usage #

## Instructions ##

### 1. Include NuxeoClient in your project ###

On Visual Studio, run on the Package Manager Console: `PM> Install-Package NuxeoClient -Pre`

If you are developing for netcoreapp1.0, include NuxeoClient in your project.json file:

```json
{
  ...,
  "dependencies": {
      ...,
      "NuxeoClient": "1.0.0-*"
  },
  ...
}
```

... and run `dotnet restore`.

### 2. Reference it in the code ###

Reference *NuxeoClient* and *NuxeoClient.Wrappers* namespaces:

```csharp
using NuxeoClient;
using NuxeoClient.Wrappers;
```

### 3. Now let's create an instance of NuxeoClient and use it! ###

Create a new instance of NuxeoClient:

```csharp
Client client = new Client(); // assuming server running on localhost:8080
```

Create a folder named "Test Folder 1" on the root:

```csharp
client.Operation("Document.Create")
      .SetInput("doc:/")
      .SetParameter("type", "Folder")
      .SetParameter("name", "TestFolder1")
      .SetParameter("properties", new ParamProperties { { "dc:title", "Test Folder 1" } })
      .Execute();
```

Please check the tests on *test/TCK* for more usage examples and the [tutorial](#tutorial) and the end of this document.

A demo app making use of this client is also available [here](https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-dotnet-browser).

## Tutorial ##

Let's make a quick console app using .NET Core, which creates a folder on the server's root and a child document. This quit tutorial assumes that you have an instance of Nuxeo Server running on your local machine.

* Create a new directory for your project named *TestNuxeoApp* and `cd` there

* Create a new *project.json* with dependencies to "System.Console" and "NuxeoClient". It should look something like this:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Nuxeo Test App",
  "authors": [ "John Doe" ],
  "buildOptions": {
    "emitEntryPoint": true
  },
  "frameworks": {
    "netcoreapp1.0": {
      "dependencies": {
        "System.Console": "4.0.0",
        "NuxeoClient": "1.0.0-beta-13281"
      }
    }
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "Microsoft.NETCore.App": {
      "type": "platform",
      "version": "1.0.1"
    }
  }
}
```

* Inside the project directory, create a new file named *Program.cs*. Make it create a new Nuxeo Client, create a folder in the server's root directory named "My Folder", and then a file inside My Folder named "My File". It should look something like this:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using NuxeoClient;
using NuxeoClient.Wrappers;

namespace TestNuxeoApp
{
	public class Program
	{
		public static void Main(string[] args)
		{
			// create a new Nuxeo Client, which is a disposable objects
			using(var client = new Client())
			{
				// let's create an async job that doesn't block
				Task.Run(async () => {
					// perform an async request to create a folder on the root with the title "My Folder"
					Document folder = (Document)await client.Operation("Document.Create")
															.SetInput("doc:/")
															.SetParameter("type", "Folder")
															.SetParameter("name", "MyFolder")
															.SetParameter("properties", new ParamProperties { { "dc:title", "My Folder" } })
															.Execute();

					// print the returned folder object if it is not null			
					Console.WriteLine(folder == null ? "Failed to create folder." : "Created " + folder.Path);

					// perform an async request to create a child file named "My File"						
					Document file = (Document)await folder.Post(new Document {
						Type = "File",
						Name = "MyFile",
						Properties = new Properties { { "dc:title", "My File" } }
					});

					// print the returned file object if it is not null					   
					Console.WriteLine(file == null ? "Failed to create file." : "Created " + file.Path);
				}).Wait(); // let's wait for the task to complete
			}
		}
	}
}
```

* Restore dependencies by running `dotnet restore`

* Run the app by running `dotnet run`

* Check the server and verify that the documents were created
